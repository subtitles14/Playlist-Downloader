Over the weekend, I built a Python script that downloads an entire YouTube playlist automatically.
Hereâ€™s how it works:
âœ… I run the script and paste the playlist link
âœ… It asks for a download location
âœ… I choose the resolution (like 720p)
âœ… The script fetches all videos and downloads them neatly into a local folder

No more manual downloads â€” everything is automated in just a few lines of Python code using yt_dlp.

This small project taught me about:
ðŸ”¹ Handling user inputs in Python
ðŸ”¹ Using yt_dlp for media automation
ðŸ”¹ Structuring outputs for organized storage

ðŸ“‚ End result: A fully downloaded playlist, ready offline!

ðŸ’¡ Next step: Expanding this to include subtitle downloads and background scheduling.
